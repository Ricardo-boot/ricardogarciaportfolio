                    <h1> Content Strategy:</h1>
                    <p>A brief description of my websites structure and the contents detailed</p>
                </div>
            <h3><strong>Navbar:</strong></h3>
            <p>I would like the navigation bar to bear a custom brand, designed specifically to represent me, and be orientated to the left side of the navigation
                bar.The navigation bar wont actually have its own color or border, rather they links will be colored white with black outline and the background
            will be fully transparent and share the same background as the the "Introduction" section. The Navigation bar will have quick links to every
            section of the website. It will change to a hamburger menu on mobile layouts.</p>
            <h3>Introduction:</h3>
            <p>This entire section will have a background image of local scenery, like the Sandia Mountains or Rout 66. I would also like to implement a dark mode function at
            the top right of the screen for individuals who prefer a darker layout. This will be the first element of my page that any potential employer/partner will see
            when they click on my page. I want to have a Jumbotron or jumbotron like element that will have the words "Web design & Development" in bold letters across
            the top with a description of what I am offering as a developer right below. Will make the background transparent to allow the background image to show.</p>
            <h3>About Me:</h3>
            <p>Below the Introduction, there will be a rounded image in the center of the page with a profile picture of myself.
            Right below this image, I want to have a card box, containing information about myself such as name, age, occupation, and description of who I am
            in a paragraph like fashion, no bullet points. </p>
            <h3>Skills/Certs:</h3>
            <p>This section will be a carousel that will display all of the certifications and that I hold and information about what they are. Will also display
            skills and knowledge of languages and tools like HTML, CSS, MySQL, etc.. though these I will have displayed on a single carousel page.</p>
            <h3>Projects:</h3>
            <p>Below the cert/skills carousel, I will have a set of cards with images on top. These cards will each have projects of mine that I have made or that
            I am currently working on. The cards will be side by side and as the number of projects increase, the cards will have a carousel/rotating feature.</p>
            <h3>Contact Form:</h3>
            <p>At the bottom of the page, below the projects section. Background image of a different local piece of scenery. The contact form box element
            will be slightly transparent to all the background to show through a little bit. Contact form will include several ways to get in touch with me including
            phone number, Email, and a link to my linkedin profile.</p>
            <h3>Footer:</h3>
            <p>Simple solid black footer at the bottom of the screen spanning the entire page length. Will have icon links to my linkedIn and github profiles.</p>
