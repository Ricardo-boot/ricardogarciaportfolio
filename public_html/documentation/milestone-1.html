            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>My personal website will be a professional portfolio that will aid in developing my professional career as a web developer, programmer, and all around IT specialist.
            It will serve as a base for showcasing and directing to every project that I decide to create and work on from here on out as well as allowing any interested employers or teams
            to contact me. This project will also serve as a grounds for displaying my evolving ability through the constant updates and features that I implement to it as I learn more and more
            skills.</p>
            <h2>Audience</h2>
            <p>My target audience for this project will be both professional and non-professional individuals with the intention of wanting me to colloaborate with them. Whether employers reaching out for
            a job opportunity, peers seeking to find a team member for their personal project, or an inquiring individual who wishes to learn about web development themselves, I will let this portfolio
            serve as a gateway to any potential avenue of developing my web development abilities.</p>
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>To get the attention of employers and potential clients.</li>
