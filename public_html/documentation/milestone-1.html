            a job opportunity, peers seeking to find a team member for their personal project, or an inquiring individual who wishes to learn about web development themselves, I will let this portfolio
            serve as a gateway to any potential avenue of developing my web development abilities.</p>

            <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dylan May</p>
            <p><strong>Age:</strong> 26</p>
            <p><strong>Profession:</strong> Self employed web developer that has been running his business with only himself
            and a few other devs to help him manage the work load. Works mainly from home in a specially furnished room that
            he has made into his office. His work consists of developing clean websites with great functionality for clients that
            range from small business start ups to big commercial chains.</p>
            <p><strong>Technology:</strong> Custom built PC, 1,400 dollars worth of the some of the best components that have
            just released out on the market. Uses his desktop for work, simple multitasking programs, high quality gaming, and video
            editing and rendering. Owns a Rasberry Pi for use with tinkering and learning about blockchain technology and hooking
            into the ethereum network. Owns a Samsung Galaxy A10e as its a solid price and he enjoys customizing his phone as much
            as he wants, running emulators and changing the display and icons on everything as well as installing custom widgets
            that he developed.</p>
            <p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> Pretty laid back, but very serious about the quality of his work and
            maintaining a bit of punctuality. Always has work that needs to be doing as he is good at socializing which allows him
            to network and connect with potential client either directly or indirectly. Finds himself stressed out at times
            due to the size of the work load and requires a few more hands to help with all his clients. Uses social media mainly
            for professional tasks and the occasional contact to get together with friends, as he tries to limit it as he sees it
            as a time sink for anything not related to work or news. Wants to really get to know a candidate first, and will
            give them a chance of proving themselves by working for a week or two first so that he can get a deeper understanding of
            the type of person he is hiring, as he knows that quickly gleaning at candidates wont really show him what kind
            of individual he is hiring.</p>
            <p><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> Dylan needs an employee who understands the tools that he is working with
            as well as all the encompassing technology and software so that he doesn't need to constantly teach them everything.
            He is looking for somebody who is excited about working as a web developer and spends a lot of their time researching the
            subject and always learning new skills in order to stay relevant in the field. Dylan puts priority on skill and knowledge
            rather than if someone has a "positive" personality, though he still keeps courteousness in mind. Dylans only frustrations
            are that he feels that he doesn't have enough time to properly get to know someone before hiring them.</p>
            <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Dylan wants and expects to see what my capabilities are through looking at my portfolio. He
            wants to see that the work is of good quality and that everything functions properly and has no bugs. Through my porfolio
            he expects to see how creative my ideas for websites are and how well I am able to execute that idea.</p>
            <p><strong>User-Story:</strong> As a web developer, I need to find an individual who takes web development seriously,
            has a passion for it and spends a good portion of his free time studying it and constantly expanding his pool of knowledge
            in order to bring this with him to the company.</p>
